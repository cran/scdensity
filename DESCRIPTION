Description: Implements methods for obtaining kernel density estimates
    subject to a variety of shape constraints (unimodality, bimodality, 
    symmetry, tail monotonicity, bounds, and constraints on the number of 
    inflection points). Enforcing constraints can eliminate unwanted waves or 
    kinks in the estimate, which improves its subjective appearance and can 
    also improve statistical performance. The main function scdensity() is 
    very similar to the density() function in 'stats', allowing 
    shape-restricted estimates to be obtained with little effort. The 
    methods implemented in this package are described in Wolters and Braun
