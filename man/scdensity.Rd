\description{
\code{scdensity} computes kernel density estimates that satisfy specified shape
restrictions. It is used in the same way as \code{\link[stats]{density}}, and takes
most of that function's arguments. Its default behavior is to compute a unimodal estimate.
Use argument \code{constraint} to choose different shape constraints, \code{method} to
choose a different estimation method, and \code{opts} to specify method- and
constraint-specific options. The result is a list of S3 class \code{scdensity}, which
may be inspected via print, summary, and plot methods.
}
\details{
All density estimates in this package use the Gaussian kernel.  It is the only common
kernel function with three continuous derivatives everywhere.  The \code{adjustedKDE} and
\code{weightedKDE} methods require continuous derivatives to ensure numerical stability.

The default estimation method, \code{adjustedKDE}, can handle all of the available constraints.  The
\code{weightedKDE} method can handle every constraint except \code{symmetric}, while the
\code{greedySharpenedKDE} method can handle only \code{unimodal}, \code{monotoneRightTail},
\code{monotoneLeftTail}, \code{boundedLeft}, and \code{boundedRight}. The \code{opts} list can
also be used to supply method-specific control parameters.  See the "Method details" section
for more.

Each constraint has a corresponding control parameter that can be supplied as an element of
\code{opts}.  The control parameters are described in the following table.  See the "Constraint
details" section for definitions of each constraint.

\if{html}{\figure{ConstraintsTable.svg}{options: width=650 alt="constraints Table"}}
\if{latex}{\figure{ConstraintsTable.pdf}{options: width=5in}}

More than one shape constraint can be specified simultaneously.  Certain combinations of constraints
(e.g., \code{unimodal} and \code{monotoneRightTail}) are redundant, and will cause a warning. Other
combinations (e.g., \code{unimodal} and \code{bimodal}) are incompatible and will cause an error.
The figure below summarizes the valid constraint combinations.

\section{Constraint details}{


All of the constraints other than \code{symmetric} are restrictions on the sign of the estimate, or
its derviatives, over certain intervals.  The boundaries of the intervals may be called
\emph{important points}. If \code{method="greedySharpenedKDE"}, the important points are determined
implicitly during estimation.  For the other methods, the locations of the important points may be
supplied in \code{opts}; in most cases they are optional.  If they are not provided, estimation
will be run iteratively inside a search routine (\code{\link{SequentialLineMin}}) to find good values,
and these values will be returned in the \code{extra} list.

Here is a list of the constraints with their definitions and any relevant comments about their
usage.

\itemize{
\item{\code{unimodal}:}{ The estimate is nondecreasing to the left of \code{opts$modeLocation}, and
nonincreasing to the right.  If \code{modeLocation} is not supplied, it is found by search.}
\item{\code{monotoneRightTail}:}{ The estimate is nonincreasing to the right of the \code{opts$rightTail}
percentile of the unconstrained estimate. \code{rightTail} is a numeric value between 0 and 100.
If it is not supplied, it is set to its default value, 90.}
\item{\code{monotoneLeftTail}:}{ The estimate is nondecreasing to the left of the \code{opts$leftTail}
percentile of the unconstrained estimate. \code{leftTail} is a numeric value between 0 and 100. If
it is not supplied, it is set to its default value, 10.}
\item{\code{twoInflections}:}{ The estimate has two inflection points, found at
\code{opts$inflectionPoints[1]} and \code{opts$inflectionPoints[2]}. This constraint implies unimodality,
but provides greater smoothness than \code{unimodal}. If \code{inflectionPoints} is not supplied, it is
found by search.}
\item{\code{twoInflections+}:}{ The \emph{derivative} of the estimate has three inflection
points, located at \code{opts$inflectionPoints[1]}, \code{opts$inflectionPoints[2]}, and
\code{opts$inflectionPoints[3]}.  This constraint implies \code{twoInflections} but is even smoother.
Most parametric densities with two tails satisfy this constraint.  If \code{inflectionPoints} is not
supplied, it is found by search.}
\item{\code{boundedLeft}:}{ The estimate is zero to the left of \code{opts$lowerBound}. The value of
\code{lowerBound} must be specified in \code{opts}. This constraint is implemented only up to a
numerical tolerance. Consequently it is still possible to use it with the Gaussian kernel.}
\item{\code{boundedRight}:}{ The estimate is zero to the right of \code{opts$upperBound}. The value of
\code{upperBound} must be specified in \code{opts}. This constraint is
implemented only up to a numerical tolerance.  Consequently it is still possible to use
it with the Gaussian kernel.}
\item{\code{symmetric}:}{ The estimate is symmetric around \code{opts$pointOfSymmetry}. If
\code{pointOfSymmetry} is not provided, it is found by search.}
\item{\code{bimodal}:}{ The estimate has modes at \code{opts$modeLocation[1]} and \code{opts$modeLocation[3]},
with an antimode (local minimum) at \code{opts$modeLocation[2]}. If \code{modeLocation} is not
specified, it is found by search.}

\section{Method details}{


The \code{adjustedKDE} and \code{weightedKDE} methods are implemented using a common framework
where the standard KDE is first approximated by a binning step, after which the constrained estimate
is obtained. The \code{greedySharpenedKDE} method uses a different approach.


\subsection{adjustedKDE and weightedKDE}{
The \code{adjustedKDE} method is based on the method of Wolters and Braun (2017).  The method
uses the usual unconstrained kernel density estimate as a pilot estimate, and adjusts the shape of
this estimate by adding a function to it.  The function is selected to minimally change the
shape of the pilot estimate while ensuring the constraints are satisfied. Any of the constraints
can be used with this method.

The \code{weightedKDE} method is based on the method of Hall and Huang (2002).
The method uses a weighted kernel density estimator, with the weights minimally
perturbed such that the constraint is satisfied. Any of the constraints except \code{symmetric}
may be used with this method.

For either of these methods, the following optional arguments can be provided as elements of \code{opts}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ncheck}:  The number of abscissa points used for constraint checking.  By default,
  this is set to \code{max(100, ceiling((diff(range(x)) + 6*h) / h))}, where \code{h} is
  the bandwidth. With this default it should be rare to encounter constraint violations large enough
  to be visible in a plot.  In the event that constraint violations are observed, re-run the estimation
  with a larger value of \code{ncheck}.
\item \code{verbose}: If \code{TRUE}, progress information will be displayed in the console.
  The main use of this is to track the progress of the search for important points. Default is \code{FALSE}.
}

When either of these methods are used, the output list \code{extra} contains elements giving the locations of the
important points used in the final estimate (e.g., \code{modeLocation} if the estimate is unimodal or
bimodal). Additionally, it containts the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{conCheckGrid}: A vector giving the abscissa values at which the constraints were enforced.
\item \code{binnedCenters}: A vector giving the locations of the kernel centers determined in the
  binning step.
\item \code{binnedWeights}: The weights corresponding to the binned centers.
\item \code{finalCenters}: The kernel centers used for the final estimate.
\item \code{finalWeights}: The weights used for the final estimate.
}
}

\subsection{greedySharpenedKDE}{
The \code{greedySharpenedKDE} method is described in Wolters (2012a, 2012b). It uses a data sharpening
(shifting the data points) approach.  Starting from an initial solution that satisfies the constraints,
a greedy algorithm (implemented in the function \code{\link{improve}}) is used to move the points as close as
possible to the observed data while maintaining feasibility.

The following optional arguments can be provided as elements of \code{opts}:
\itemize{
\item \code{startValue} --- A vector of the same length as \code{x}, giving the feasible
initial solution from which the algorithm is started.  If not specified, a vector with
all data points at the location of the unconstrained estimate's highest mode will be used.
Note, it is not guaranteed that the default will satisfy every constraint for every data
set.
\item \code{verbose}: If \code{TRUE}, information about iteration progress will be printed
to the console. Default is \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{maxpasses}: Each "pass" through the data points moves each point one-by-one in a greedy fasion.
This option limits the maximum number of passes. Default is 500.
\item \code{tol}: A numerical tolerance for constraint checking.  See \code{\link{improve}}.
\item \code{ILS}: An integer greater than zero.  If supplied, the greedy algorithm is run inside an
iterated local search metaheuristic, as described in Wolters (2012b, sec. 3.4). This can improve solution
quality, but requires the greedy search to be run \code{2*ILS} extra times.
}
When this method is used, the output list \code{extra} contains the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{xstar}: The final vector of "sharpened" data points used to generate the
estimate.
}
}
